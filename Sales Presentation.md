## SLIDE 2: The Challenge
**Visual:** Split screen showing chaos vs. order

### On-Screen Text:
```
Manufacturing Today: Common Pain Points

• Disconnected systems (spreadsheets, emails, legacy software)
• Manual data entry and errors
• No real-time visibility into production
• Inventory shortages and overstocking
• Missed delivery dates
• Lost quotes and follow-ups
• Difficulty tracking costs and margins
```

### Speaker Notes:
"Let me start by asking: How many different systems do you currently use to manage your manufacturing operations? Most manufacturers we work with are juggling 5-10 different tools - Excel spreadsheets for inventory, email for quotes, separate systems for production tracking, and manual processes everywhere in between.

This creates three critical problems: First, you're wasting countless hours on manual data entry and reconciliation. Second, you have no real-time visibility into what's actually happening on your factory floor. And third, you're likely losing money without even knowing it - through stockouts, overproduction, or simply not knowing your true manufacturing costs.

Does this sound familiar?"

### On-Screen Text:
```
Labamu Manufacturing
One Platform. Complete Control.

✓ End-to-end sales workflow (RFQ → Quote → Order → Invoice)
✓ Manufacturing intelligence (Recipes, BOMs, Production tracking)
✓ Real-time inventory management
✓ Logistics and shipping
✓ Financial analytics and reporting
✓ Integrated financing options
```

### Speaker Notes:
"Labamu Manufacturing is a complete, all-in-one platform that eliminates the chaos. Everything you need to run your manufacturing business is in one place - from the moment a customer requests a quote to the moment you get paid.

What makes us different is that we understand manufacturing. This isn't a generic ERP system that's been retrofitted for manufacturing. It's built from the ground up for manufacturers, by people who understand your challenges."

## SLIDE 4: Platform Architecture
**Visual:** Diagram showing integrated modules

### On-Screen Text:
```
Integrated Modules Working Together

[Sales] → [Manufacturing] → [Inventory] → [Logistics] → [Finance]

• Seamless data flow between all modules
• Single source of truth
• Real-time updates across the platform
• No more manual data entry
```

### Speaker Notes:
"Let me show you how everything connects. When a quote is approved and becomes an order, the system automatically checks inventory, reserves materials using FIFO/FEFO logic, creates production schedules based on your recipes, and even helps you track production progress in real-time.

This isn't just about storing information - it's about intelligence. The system knows your recipes, your inventory levels, your production capacity, and your costs. It uses this intelligence to help you make better decisions."

---

## SLIDE 5: Sales Workflow Deep Dive
**Visual:** Flow diagram: RFQ → Quote → Order → Invoice

### On-Screen Text:
```
Sales Made Simple

1. RFQ Management: Capture all customer inquiries
2. Smart Quoting: Product catalog + custom products + pricing
3. Order Processing: Automatic material reservation
4. Invoice Generation: Direct from orders
5. Conversion Tracking: See what converts, what doesn't
```

### Speaker Notes:
"Let's start with how you interact with customers. Every inquiry that comes in - whether it's a standard product or a custom manufacturing request - gets captured as an RFQ in the system.

From there, you can quickly generate professional quotes. For standard products, it's as simple as selecting from your catalog. For custom products, you can upload drawings, specifications, and documents. The system remembers everything.

Once a quote is accepted, it becomes an order with a single click. The system immediately reserves the materials you need, creates the production plan, and sets up tracking. No more scrambling to figure out if you have enough inventory or capacity.

And here's the key: You can see exactly which quotes are converting and which aren't. This helps you improve your pricing and sales strategy over time."

## SLIDE 6: Product & Recipe Management
**Visual:** Screenshot of recipe with BOM

### On-Screen Text:
```
Manufacturing Intelligence

Recipe Management:
• Bill of Materials (BOM) with exact quantities
• Routing stages (step-by-step production process)
• Personnel requirements per stage
• Machine requirements and setup times
• Automatic cost calculation
• Recipe variants for product variations
```

### Speaker Notes:
"This is where Labamu really shines for manufacturers. You can define exactly how each product is made - not just the materials, but the entire process.

Let's say you manufacture furniture. You can create a recipe that says: 'First, cut the wood to size - this takes 2 hours on the CNC machine with 1 operator. Then, sand the pieces - this takes 3 hours with 2 workers. Then, apply finish - this takes 1 hour, then cure for 24 hours. Finally, assemble - this takes 2 hours with 1 skilled assembler.'

The system automatically calculates your true manufacturing cost based on material costs, labor hours, and machine time. No more guessing. You know exactly what it costs to make each product.

And when an order comes in, the system knows exactly what materials to reserve, which machines you'll need, and how long production will take."

---

## SLIDE 7: Real-Time Production Tracking
**Visual:** Production progress dashboard

### On-Screen Text:
```
Know Exactly What's Happening

Order Status Dashboard:
• Real-time production progress by stage
• Units completed vs. units remaining
• Material allocation status
• Expected completion dates
• Bottleneck identification
```

### Speaker Notes:
"One of the biggest frustrations manufacturers tell us about is not knowing where things stand. When a customer calls asking about their order, you shouldn't have to walk to the factory floor to find out.

With Labamu, you have real-time visibility. You can see exactly how many units have completed each production stage, what's in progress, and what hasn't started yet.

If you're falling behind on an order, you'll know immediately - not when it's too late. You can proactively communicate with customers, reallocate resources, or adjust priorities.

This level of visibility is game-changing for customer satisfaction and on-time delivery."

---

## SLIDE 8: Intelligent Inventory Management
**Visual:** Inventory dashboard with charts

### On-Screen Text:
```
Never Run Out. Never Overstock.

• Batch tracking with FIFO/FEFO
• Automatic material reservation for orders
• Purchase order management
• Low stock alerts
• ABC classification
• Expiry date tracking
• Stockout risk assessment
```

### Speaker Notes:
"Inventory is one of the biggest cost centers in manufacturing. Too much, and you're tying up cash. Too little, and you're delaying orders.

Labamu gives you complete control. Every batch of material is tracked separately with its own cost, purchase date, and expiry date. When an order needs materials, the system automatically reserves the oldest batches first - so nothing sits on the shelf expiring.

The system also tells you when you're at risk of running out. You get alerts when stock is low, and you can generate purchase orders directly from the system.

We have customers who've reduced their inventory carrying costs by 30-40% while simultaneously improving on-time delivery - just by having better visibility and smarter allocation."

---

## SLIDE 9: Logistics & Export Management
**Visual:** Container tracking interface

### On-Screen Text:
```
Shipping & Export Made Easy

• Container management (20', 40', 40HC)
• Incoterms support (FOB, CIF, etc.)
• Export documentation
  - Commercial invoices
  - Packing lists
  - Export declarations
• Shipment tracking
• Port and carrier information
```

### Speaker Notes:
"For manufacturers who export - and I imagine many of you do - the logistics and documentation can be a nightmare.

Labamu streamlines everything. You can track which orders are going into which containers, manage all your Incoterms properly, and generate all the required export documentation automatically.

No more scrambling at the last minute to prepare commercial invoices or packing lists. The system has all the information - product details, quantities, values, customer information - and generates the documents for you.

This alone saves our customers dozens of hours per month and eliminates costly documentation errors."

## SLIDE 10: Financial Intelligence
**Visual:** Financial dashboard with KPIs

### On-Screen Text:
```
Know Your Numbers

Real-Time Analytics:
• Gross margin by product
• Order value and profitability
• Inventory value and composition
• Cost tracking (materials, labor, overhead)
• RFQ conversion rates
• Payment status tracking
• Multi-currency support with FX management
```

### Speaker Notes:
"At the end of the day, you're running a business. You need to know if you're making money.

Labamu gives you complete financial visibility. You can see your gross margin by product - which products are profitable and which aren't. You can track your inventory value in real-time. You can see which customers are paying on time and which aren't.

The system supports multiple currencies and handles foreign exchange properly, which is critical if you're exporting.

Many of our customers tell us they had no idea which products were actually profitable until they started using Labamu. Some products they thought were winners were actually losing money once you factored in the true manufacturing cost."

---

## SLIDE 11: Financing Integration
**Visual:** Financing application interface

### On-Screen Text:
```
Access to Capital

Integrated Financing Options:
• Domestic financing (purchase orders & invoices)
• International trade financing
• Invoice insurance
• Streamlined application process
• Track application status
```

### Speaker Notes:
"We also understand that cash flow is critical in manufacturing. Large orders tie up a lot of capital, especially if you're producing for export with long payment terms.

That's why we've integrated financing options directly into the platform. You can apply for purchase order financing, invoice factoring, or trade finance without leaving the system.

This gives you access to working capital to take on bigger orders without straining your cash flow."

## SLIDE 12: ROI & Benefits
**Visual:** Bar chart showing improvements

### On-Screen Text:
```
Typical Customer Results (First Year)

✓ 80% reduction in manual data entry
✓ 30-40% reduction in inventory carrying costs
✓ 25% improvement in on-time delivery
✓ 15-20% improvement in gross margin (better visibility)
✓ 50% faster quote-to-order conversion
✓ 90% reduction in documentation errors
✓ Complete real-time visibility into operations
```

### Speaker Notes:
"Let me share what our customers typically see in their first year:

They reduce manual data entry by about 80% - that's dozens of hours per week that staff can spend on higher-value activities instead of copying data between systems.

They reduce inventory costs by 30-40% through better visibility and smarter allocation.

On-time delivery improves by about 25% because they can see problems before they become critical.

And here's the big one: gross margin improves by 15-20%, not because they raise prices, but because they finally know their true costs and can make better decisions about pricing and which orders to accept.

The system typically pays for itself within 3-6 months just from inventory reduction and time savings alone."

Let Me Show You

Live Platform Walkthrough
```

### Speaker Notes:
"Alright, enough slides. Let me actually show you the platform in action. I'll walk you through a real example - we'll create an RFQ, generate a quote, convert it to an order, and track it through production."

### Demo Flow (5-7 minutes):
1. **Create RFQ:** Show how customer inquiry is captured
2. **Generate Quote:** Select products, show pricing, add custom product
3. **Convert to Order:** Single click conversion, show material reservation
4. **View Production:** Show routing stages, update progress
5. **Check Inventory:** Show batch tracking, reservations
6. **Generate Invoice:** Show invoice generation from order

### Demo Script:
"Let's say a customer just sent us an inquiry for 100 wooden chairs. I'll create an RFQ... [capture details]. Now I can generate a quote - I select the chair product from our catalog, enter quantity, and the system automatically calculates pricing based on our recipe costs with our markup...

The customer accepted! One click, and this becomes an order. Notice what just happened - the system automatically reserved the materials we need from our inventory, using the oldest batches first. It created the production plan based on our chair recipe, showing all the routing stages...

Now as production progresses, we can update the status. Let's say we've completed cutting for 50 units... [update progress]. You can see the real-time dashboard updating. We know exactly where we stand.

If I want to check inventory... [show inventory view] you can see all our materials, current stock levels, what's reserved for this order, and what's available for new orders..."
